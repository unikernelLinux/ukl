/* compare_vsyms is the main entry point for these tests.

   Indirectly, It calls __libc_dlvsym (from libc.so; internal
   interface) and dlvsym (from libdl.so; public interface) to compare
   the results for a selected set of symbols in libc.so which
   typically have more than one symbol version.  The two functions are
   implemented by somewhat different code, and this test checks that
   their results are the same.

   The versions are generated to range from GLIBC_2.0 to GLIBC_2.Y,
   with Y being the current __GLIBC_MINOR__ version plus two.  In
   addition, there is a list of special symbol versions of the form
   GLIBC_2.Y.Z, which were used for some releases.

   Comparing the two dlvsym results at versions which do not actually
   exist does not test much, but it will not contribute to false test
   failures, either.  */
