/* Adjustments and additions to the signal number constants for
   Linux/HPPA.  These values were originally chosen for HP/UX
   compatibility, but were renumbered as of kernel 3.17 and glibc 2.21
   to accommodate software (notably systemd) that assumed at least 29
   real-time signal numbers would be available.  SIGEMT and SIGLOST
   were removed, and the values of SIGSTKFLT, SIGXCPU, XIGXFSZ, and
   SIGSYS were changed, enabling __SIGRTMIN to be 32.  */
