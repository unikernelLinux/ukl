	 There are the following cases for the kind of a mutex		\
	 (The mask PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_FLAGS_NP covers the flags	\
	 PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP and PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP where	\
	 only one of both flags can be set):				\
	 - both flags are not set:					\
	 This is the first lock operation for this mutex.  Enable	\
	 elision as it is not enabled so far.				\
	 Note: It can happen that multiple threads are calling e.g.	\
	 pthread_mutex_lock at the same time as the first lock		\
	 operation for this mutex.  Then elision is enabled for this	\
	 mutex by multiple threads.  Storing with relaxed MO is enough	\
	 as all threads will store the same new value for the kind of	\
	 the mutex.  But we have to ensure that we always use the	\
	 elision path regardless if this thread has enabled elision or	\
	 another one.							\
									\
	 - PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP flag is set:			\
	 Elision was already enabled for this mutex by a previous lock	\
	 operation.  See case above.  Just use the elision path.	\
									\
	 - PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP flag is set:			\
	 Elision was explicitly disabled by pthread_mutexattr_settype.	\
	 Do not use the elision path.					\
	 Note: The flag PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP will never be	\
	 changed after mutex initialization.  */			\
