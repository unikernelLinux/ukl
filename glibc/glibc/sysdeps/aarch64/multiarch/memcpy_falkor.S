/* Copies are split into 3 main cases:

   1. Small copies of up to 32 bytes
   2. Medium copies of 33..128 bytes which are fully unrolled
   3. Large copies of more than 128 bytes.

   Large copies align the sourceto a quad word and use an unrolled loop
   processing 64 bytes per iteration.

   FALKOR-SPECIFIC DESIGN:

   The smallest copies (32 bytes or less) focus on optimal pipeline usage,
   which is why the redundant copies of 0-3 bytes have been replaced with
   conditionals, since the former would unnecessarily break across multiple
   issue groups.  The medium copy group has been enlarged to 128 bytes since
   bumping up the small copies up to 32 bytes allows us to do that without
   cost and also allows us to reduce the size of the prep code before loop64.

   The copy loop uses only one register q0.  This is to ensure that all loads
   hit a single hardware prefetcher which can get correctly trained to prefetch
   a single stream.

   The non-temporal stores help optimize cache utilization.  */
