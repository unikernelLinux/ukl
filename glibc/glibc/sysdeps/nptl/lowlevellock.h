/* Low-level locks use a combination of atomic operations (to acquire and
   release lock ownership) and futex operations (to block until the state
   of a lock changes).  A lock can be in one of three states:
   0:  not acquired,
   1:  acquired with no waiters; no other threads are blocked or about to block
       for changes to the lock state,
   >1: acquired, possibly with waiters; there may be other threads blocked or
       about to block for changes to the lock state.

   We expect that the common case is an uncontended lock, so we just need
   to transition the lock between states 0 and 1; releasing the lock does
   not need to wake any other blocked threads.  If the lock is contended
   and a thread decides to block using a futex operation, then this thread
   needs to first change the state to >1; if this state is observed during
   lock release, the releasing thread will wake one of the potentially
   blocked threads.

   Much of this code takes a 'private' parameter.  This may be:
   LLL_PRIVATE: lock only shared within a process
   LLL_SHARED:  lock may be shared across processes.

   Condition variables contain an optimization for broadcasts that requeues
   waiting threads on a lock's futex.  Therefore, there is a special
   variant of the locks (whose name contains "cond") that makes sure to
   always set the lock state to >1 and not just 1.

   Robust locks set the lock to the id of the owner.  This allows detection
   of the case where the owner exits without releasing the lock.  Flags are
   OR'd with the owner id to record additional information about lock state.
   Therefore the states of robust locks are:
    0: not acquired
   id: acquired (by user identified by id & FUTEX_TID_MASK)

   The following flags may be set in the robust lock value:
   FUTEX_WAITERS     - possibly has waiters
   FUTEX_OWNER_DIED  - owning user has exited without releasing the futex.  */

   acquires the lock and when there will be no further lock acquisitions;
