/* CONCURRENCY NOTES:

   Understanding who is the owner of the 'struct pthread' or 'PD'
   (refers to the value of the 'struct pthread *pd' function argument)
   is critically important in determining exactly which operations are
   allowed and which are not and when, particularly when it comes to the
   implementation of pthread_create, pthread_join, pthread_detach, and
   other functions which all operate on PD.

   The owner of PD is responsible for freeing the final resources
   associated with PD, and may examine the memory underlying PD at any
   point in time until it frees it back to the OS or to reuse by the
   runtime.

   The thread which calls pthread_create is called the creating thread.
   The creating thread begins as the owner of PD.

   During startup the new thread may examine PD in coordination with the
   owner thread (which may be itself).

   The four cases of ownership transfer are:

   (1) Ownership of PD is released to the process (all threads may use it)
       after the new thread starts in a joinable state
       i.e. pthread_create returns a usable pthread_t.

   (2) Ownership of PD is released to the new thread starting in a detached
       state.

   (3) Ownership of PD is dynamically released to a running thread via
       pthread_detach.

   (4) Ownership of PD is acquired by the thread which calls pthread_join.

   Implementation notes:

   The PD->stopped_start and thread_ran variables are used to determine
   exactly which of the four ownership states we are in and therefore
   what actions can be taken.  For example after (2) we cannot read or
   write from PD anymore since the thread may no longer exist and the
   memory may be unmapped.

   It is important to point out that PD->lock is being used both
   similar to a one-shot semaphore and subsequently as a mutex.  The
   lock is taken in the parent to force the child to wait, and then the
   child releases the lock.  However, this semaphore-like effect is used
   only for synchronizing the parent and child.  After startup the lock
   is used like a mutex to create a critical section during which a
   single owner modifies the thread parameters.

   The most complicated cases happen during thread startup:

   (a) If the created thread is in a detached (PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED),
       or joinable (default PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE) state and
       STOPPED_START is true, then the creating thread has ownership of
       PD until the PD->lock is released by pthread_create.  If any
       errors occur we are in states (c), (d), or (e) below.

   (b) If the created thread is in a detached state
       (PTHREAD_CREATED_DETACHED), and STOPPED_START is false, then the
       creating thread has ownership of PD until it invokes the OS
       kernel's thread creation routine.  If this routine returns
       without error, then the created thread owns PD; otherwise, see
       (c) and (e) below.

   (c) If the detached thread setup failed and THREAD_RAN is true, then
       the creating thread releases ownership to the new thread by
       sending a cancellation signal.  All threads set THREAD_RAN to
       true as quickly as possible after returning from the OS kernel's
       thread creation routine.

   (d) If the joinable thread setup failed and THREAD_RAN is true, then
       then the creating thread retains ownership of PD and must cleanup
       state.  Ownership cannot be released to the process via the
       return of pthread_create since a non-zero result entails PD is
       undefined and therefore cannot be joined to free the resources.
       We privately call pthread_join on the thread to finish handling
       the resource shutdown (Or at least we should, see bug 19511).

   (e) If the thread creation failed and THREAD_RAN is false, then the
       creating thread retains ownership of PD and must cleanup state.
       No waiting for the new thread is required because it never
       started.

   The nptl_db interface:

   The interface with nptl_db requires that we enqueue PD into a linked
   list and then call a function which the debugger will trap.  The PD
   will then be dequeued and control returned to the thread.  The caller
   at the time must have ownership of PD and such ownership remains
   after control returns to thread. The enqueued PD is removed from the
   linked list by the nptl_db callback td_thr_event_getmsg.  The debugger
   must ensure that the thread does not resume execution, otherwise
   ownership of PD may be lost and examining PD will not be possible.

   Note that the GNU Debugger as of (December 10th 2015) commit
   c2c2a31fdb228d41ce3db62b268efea04bd39c18 no longer uses
   td_thr_event_getmsg and several other related nptl_db interfaces. The
   principal reason for this is that nptl_db does not support non-stop
   mode where other threads can run concurrently and modify runtime
   structures currently in use by the debugger and the nptl_db
   interface.

   Axioms:

   * The create_thread function can never set stopped_start to false.
   * The created thread can read stopped_start but never write to it.
   * The variable thread_ran is set some time after the OS thread
     creation routine returns, how much time after the thread is created
     is unspecified, but it should be as quickly as possible.

*/

/* CREATE THREAD NOTES:

   createthread.c defines the create_thread function, and two macros:
   START_THREAD_DEFN and START_THREAD_SELF (see below).

   create_thread must initialize PD->stopped_start.  It should be true
   if the STOPPED_START parameter is true, or if create_thread needs the
   new thread to synchronize at startup for some other implementation
   reason.  If STOPPED_START will be true, then create_thread is obliged
   to lock PD->lock before starting the thread.  Then pthread_create
   unlocks PD->lock which synchronizes-with START_THREAD_DEFN in the
   child thread which does an acquire/release of PD->lock as the last
   action before calling the user entry point.  The goal of all of this
   is to ensure that the required initial thread attributes are applied
   (by the creating thread) before the new thread runs user code.  Note
   that the the functions pthread_getschedparam, pthread_setschedparam,
   pthread_setschedprio, __pthread_tpp_change_priority, and
   __pthread_current_priority reuse the same lock, PD->lock, for a
   similar purpose e.g. synchronizing the setting of similar thread
   attributes.  These functions are never called before the thread is
   created, so don't participate in startup syncronization, but given
   that the lock is present already and in the unlocked state, reusing
   it saves space.

   The return value is zero for success or an errno code for failure.
   If the return value is ENOMEM, that will be translated to EAGAIN,
   so create_thread need not do that.  On failure, *THREAD_RAN should
   be set to true iff the thread actually started up and then got
   canceled before calling user code (*PD->start_routine).  */
