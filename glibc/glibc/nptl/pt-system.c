/* libpthread once had its own 'system', though there was no apparent
   reason for it.  There is no use in having a separate symbol in
   libpthread, but the historical ABI requires it.  For static linking,
   there is no need to provide anything here--the libc version will be
   linked in.  For shared library ABI compatibility, there must be a
   'system' symbol in libpthread.so.

   With an IFUNC resolver, it would be possible to avoid the indirection,
   but the IFUNC resolver might run before the __libc_system symbol has
   been relocated, in which case the IFUNC resolver would not be able to
   provide the correct address.  */
